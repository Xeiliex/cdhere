CDHERE
======

`cdhere` is a Windows command-line program that changes the current directory 
to whatever directory the topmost Explorer window is looking at. In other 
words, it is the reverse of the many "[Open][1] [Command][2] [Window][3] 
[Here][4]" tricks that exist for various versions of Windows. Instead of
opening a new command window for each directory in which you want to do work.
you move the current directory in an existing console to where you want it to
be.
